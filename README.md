# Applied_CV_individual_project

To run this code, you need access to the CNN trained model. The trained model is saved as a heirarchial data file containing all the weights for the architecture. However, that file is too large to upload on github. Please email me at sn3031@columbia.edu, if you would like to see that file too, thank you!
